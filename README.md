# Just Do It

## Motivation
While we all are stuck inside our houses due to stay at home orders, we thought it would be a good idea to implement a fitness app to help people do exercises at home to stay healthy. It is important to keep your body healthy to also improve your mental health. It is essential for students to maintain good health during our studies.
